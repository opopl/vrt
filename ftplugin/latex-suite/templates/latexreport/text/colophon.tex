\chapter*{Colophon}

The cover layout was designed with GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation
Toolkit.  The layout of the report is designed by the authors of the
report with support and suggestions from many individuals and
implemented in \LaTeXe. The class file is available from Department of
Communication Systems as \texttt{iesreport.cls} at
\texttt{http://www.\-kom.\-auc.\-dk/\-net/\-support/\-courses/latex.html}.
The text and heading fonts are Adobe Times and Adobe Helvetica.
Figures were drawn with Xfig, Gnome Dia and kivio or produced directly
with Matlab\texttrademark\/ or Gnuplot. The final report was prepared
with \LaTeX\/ and \texttt{dvips} of the te\TeX\/ distribution
release~1.0.7.

The layout style of this report is a result of discussions with and
feedback from students at the Institute of Electronic Systems. The
cover of a master thesis report at Aalborg University often reflect
the product that is created during the project period, and the front
page images on the cover shows a ***Warning***.
